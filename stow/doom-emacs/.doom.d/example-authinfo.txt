# Sample .authinfo file for database credentials
# This is an example file showing how to format entries for your .authinfo.gpg file
# WARNING: DO NOT USE THIS UNENCRYPTED FILE FOR ACTUAL CREDENTIALS!

# Format: machine DATABASE-NAME-db login USERNAME password PASSWORD

# SQLNovel database credentials
machine sqlnovel-db login oscarvarto password your_secure_password_here

# usqa3 database credentials
machine usqa3-db login sqa_automation password your_secure_password_here

# 1. How to create/update your encrypted .authinfo.gpg file:
#    a. Copy the entries you need from this example (without the comments)
#    b. If you already have a .authinfo.gpg file:
#       - Decrypt it: gpg -d ~/.authinfo.gpg > ~/.authinfo.temp
#       - Add your new entries to ~/.authinfo.temp
#       - Encrypt it again: gpg -e -r YOUR_GPG_ID ~/.authinfo.temp > ~/.authinfo.gpg
#       - Remove the temporary file: rm ~/.authinfo.temp
#    c. If you don't have a .authinfo.gpg file:
#       - Create a new file with your entries: ~/.authinfo
#       - Encrypt it: gpg -e -r YOUR_GPG_ID ~/.authinfo > ~/.authinfo.gpg
#       - Remove the plaintext file: rm ~/.authinfo

# 2. Setting up equivalent entries in 1Password:
#    a. Create a new login item in 1Password for each database
#    b. Name the item exactly as you reference it in the code
#       - For SQLNovel: Name should be "SQLNovel"
#       - For usqa3: Name should be "usqa3"
#    c. Add the following fields to each item:
#       - Username: the database username (e.g., "oscarvarto" or "sqa_automation")
#       - Password: the database password
#    d. You can add additional fields like:
#       - Database: the database name
#       - Host: the database host
#       - Port: the database port
#    e. Make sure the 1Password CLI is authenticated:
#       - Run `op signin` in your terminal
#       - For longer sessions, see 1Password CLI documentation

# 3. Important security notes:
#    - The auth-source approach with .authinfo.gpg is native to Emacs and works offline
#    - The 1Password approach requires the CLI to be authenticated but is more secure and centralized
#    - If you use both methods, auth-source (.authinfo.gpg) is tried first, then 1Password
